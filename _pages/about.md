Cancer genomics has enabled the exhaustive molecular characterization of tumors and have shown that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and melanoma as among the most complex cancers. This complexity has triggered the development of mouse models that generate histologically similar tumors but have not been systematically validated at the molecular level. Accurate models of the molecular pathogenesis of the cancer patients are essential for biomedical progress. Immunotherapy has shown promising responses to malignant cancers; however, resistance still occur in the majority of cases. 

My research focuses on understanding how genetic variation impacts the gene function in anti-cancer drug responses. Translation of cancer genomic data to therapeutic treatment remains challenging. To characterize how these alterations affect therapeutic responses, I analyzes molecular characteristics to see if the changes in the genomic and transcriptomic profiles are associated with the responses. Using these associations, I hope to capture the mechanisms underlying the tumor-immune interactions and thus better model the functionality impacts these cancer patients. Outside of lab, I enjoy trying different snacks, sketching, and re-reading Harry Potter books.
